					I am Sian-Tang Teng and I was born Bremen, Germany in year 1998. Moved to Hamburg and was raised ever 
					since then. I started Judo when I was six years old and continued it for 12 years. Judo played a big part of my 
					life and impacted my attitude towards work greatly.<mybr></mybr>
					It all started as a small hobby where I had training session once a week. 
					I remember learning to differentiate between left and right in one of these sessions. The teacher had marked my 
					right foot with a pencil. Now that I remember back, I was probably one of the later childs that would learn to 
					differ left from right.<mybr></mybr>
					Together with my judo friends, we went on little local tournaments and participated for fun and medals. 
					Although, I actually believe it was impossible to not get a placement and a medal. As time progressed, judo 
					was getting more serious. My training sessions continiously increased to three times a week and the 
					tournaments were getting more difficult as we were faced with more challenging enemies.

			My name Sian-Tang Teng and I was born (1998) and raised in Germany.<br />
			Judo was a big part of my life (12 years). It was integrated into my daily school life as part of the competitive
			sports program at the elite school of Hamburg.
			During my final years of school I focused solely on my academic development and therefore quit judo consequently.<br />
			After graduating school, I went to New Zealand as part of my curiosity as well as my desire to challenge myself to
			an adventure. During my time in New Zealand I worked on different kiwi plantations, climbed every possible
			mountain, spent time with people from around the world, and of course take part of every challenge
			confronted.

				<h3 style="font-size:28px">School</h3>
				<p>
					Four to five years after I started judo, I joined the competetive sports program at the Elite School of Hamburg 
					(Alter Teichweg). At this school, sport is integrated into your daily school life.
					<mybr></mybr>

					</a><mybr></mybr>
					I joined the sports class in our school. Of course there are normal classes as well since there are ordinary 
					students present. My class consists of a mix of different sports: judo, swimming, football, tennis, basketball,
					and many more. A few of my judo colleagues also joined the sport class. That made it easier to find friends. 
					Each sport had training sessions in the morning but on their own. So, in the morning from 8:00am to 9:30am 
					we trained in a designated judo training area.<mybr></mybr>
					<a class="image">
					<img src="images/full/school_judo.jpg" alt="judo image" width="734" />
					</a><mybr></mybr>
					After our training session, we went back to school and started our normal school day. Often after school, we 
					had further training sessions either at our club or a state center where many judo atheletes from Hamburg and 
					around gathered to train. In total, we had between 6-8 training sessions per week, depending on the individual
					performance and support. Usually our weekends were filled with tournaments and training camps all around 
					Germany. Sometimes even combined. In this case, we had to get special permission from school, because the 
					training camps took more than just the weekend. It was safe to say that we loved having a free weekend with 
					nothing planned and nothing to do.<mybr></mybr>
					As we were training strictly and continously for several years we reached a stage where we competed on an
					international level. Athletes from Europe and sometimes even from Asia or America competed against us in 
					bigger tournaments. Since competing reached a higher level, we athletes needed to follow a strict diet in order 
					to keep our weight class. The next weight class would mean stronger enemies. Which would result in a weaker 
					performance and less financial support.<mybr></mybr>
					I continued this lifestyle for 4-5 years until my final two years of school. I decided to focus on my academic 
					development instead of my sports development. Thus, I left the sports class and joined a normal class. In these
					two final years, I was able to live an ordinary school student life as I had plenty of time to learn and 
					interact with friends now. I graduated from school and got my first academic certificate: Abitur!

					School was done so I decided to go to New Zealand for a work & travel experience. Going abroad has been
					recommended by many people. I didn't want to miss out on this experience. New Zealand was a good
					opportunity to further strengthen my english skills, learn about a completely new culture, and challenge
					myself to an adventure.
